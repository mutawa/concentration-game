# Concentration Game

This is Project 2 Implementation of Udacity Front End Nandodegree program. It resembles a concentration game, where you have to focus and concentrate on which boxes have been open, and which have not yet been opened. The goal of the game is to match the flipped cards in as fewer moves as possible. The highest score is obtained when no mistak is made.

## How to run the game

You will need to open the browser and load the `index.html` file.

## Used Libraries

I have used [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io) to display custom fancy alert boxes instead of the native built in javascript alert boxes.

Also used [Font Awesom](https://fontawesome.com) to get access to icons for the cards. The library includes webfonts, so I had to add a folder to accommodate that as well.
